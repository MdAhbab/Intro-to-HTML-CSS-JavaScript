    "Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing. In the face of
    adversity, it is not the critic who counts, nor the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the
    doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is
    marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there
    is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great
    enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph
    of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least&nbsp;fails&nbsp;while&nbsp;daring greatly." - Theodore Roosevelt
